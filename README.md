# Decentralized Lottery Web Application

The Lottery Dapp is a web application that operates in a decentralised manner, allowing participants to join by sending a specific amount of ether to the smart contract. 
The contract owner can then use a function to select a winner at random from all the participants and send the prize money to the winner's address.  

Deployed on GOERLI test network.
